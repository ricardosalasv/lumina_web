<h1>LUMINA</h1>

<h2>Lumina is a project which is intended to calculate how many lighting fixtures are needed in a room based on its physical characteristics, its use or the activities that will be performed there, and also based on the characteristics of the chosen type of light.</h2>
<br>
<h2>The user will be able of specifying the dimensions of the space, the characteristics of the materials and finishes on the floor, wall, and ceiling/roof, and then choose a lighting fixture from the app database with its real specifications.</h2>
